# Operate First Website

For more information regarding the purpose and roadmap, view the [website](https://operate-first.cloud/) or the [markdown doc](https://github.com/operate-first/operate-first.github.io/blob/master/content/docs/operate-first/index.md)

## Usage

Customize your `.env` file similar to `.env.example`(.env.example)

### Development / Contributing

Documentation can be added directly from the repository or from a remote repository.

#### Adding a document / post

All local posts are located in the `/content/docs` directory. Each file is a Markdown (`.md`) file. Create the name of the link `my-path` and inside create an `index.md`.

`/content/docs/my-document/index.md`

```markdown
---
title: My Document
description: My Document Description
---

# Content goes here

valid markdown
```

Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) can be added in a similar manner by adding them to the `/content/docs` directory. Add the notebook(s) and create an `index.mdx` where you can import the notebook(s) to be included.

`/content/docs/my-notebook/index.mdx`  
`/content/docs/my-notebook/hello-world.ipynb`  

```markdown
---
title: My Notebook
description: My Notebook Description
---

import JupyterNotebook from '../../../src/components/JupyterNotebook'

### Title

<JupyterNotebook path="my-notebook/hello-world.ipynb"/>
```

#### Adding remote content

To add remote content, it is recommended you clone any remote content repositories or forks as you prefer at the root of this repository:
```shell script
git clone git@github.com:operate-first/continuous-deployment.git
```
Include the remote repository to `.gitignore`.

Create a separate folder within the remote repository which only consists of the document(s) to be published and its supporting files like images.

**If adding remote notebooks**, it's required to create an *.mdx file in your remote repository's publishing folder for each notebook you want to render (this file is what actually gets displayed). We recommend the following naming convention `notebook-you-want-to-publish-name.mdx` .

It is also possible to render multiple notebooks within one .mdx file if needed. Create an single .mdx file within your repository's publishing folder referencing the notebooks in the .mdx file as follows.

```markdown
---
title: My Notebook
description: My Notebook Description
---

import JupyterNotebook from '../../../src/components/JupyterNotebook'

### Title
<JupyterNotebook path="notebooks/notebook1.ipynb"/>
<JupyterNotebook path="notebooks/notebook2.ipynb"/>
...
...
```

The *.mdx files should follow the format outlined in the example above. However, depending on the directory structure of your repository the following path may need to be updated to navigate out of your cloned repo and into the correct `JupyterNotebook` directory.    

```
import JupyterNotebook from '../../../src/components/JupyterNotebook'
```


Add remote repository url and directory to get content from in `content-sources.yaml`

```yaml
- name: continuous deployment docs
  gitSrc: https://github.com/operate-first/continuous-deployment.git
  dir: continuous-deployment/docs/publish
  urlPrefix: cd
```

There are two ways you can manage the table of contents for the remote repo.

First is to include the content directly in the master `content/toc.yaml`.

```yaml
- id: continuous-deployment
  label: Continuous Deployment
  href: /cd/versions #include the filename to be added from the remote repo
```
The second way is to manage an independent `repo-toc.yaml` for the remote repo. This `repo-toc.yaml` can be located in the `content` directory or also fetched from the remote repo if needed.

Based on whether using the file from the local repo or the cloned repo, make sure to include the file in the `toc-sources.yaml`

```yaml
- content/cd-toc.yaml # using file from local repo
- continuous-deployment/docs/publish/toc.yaml # using file from cloned repo
```

#### Local Development


You can run the app locally to preview your changes.
In terminal:

```shell script
make dev
```

If you have problems, run `make dev-clean`

#### Previewing your changes on GitHub pages

When previewing your changes on a fork.

First, enable github pages to use the gh-pages branch from root.

![](misc/gh-pages-fork.png)

Make sure to push your changes to your branch on the fork.

Then, from your branch manually build and push.

```shell script
make gh-pages-fork
```

Now you can view your work on `https://githubuserid.github.io/operate-first.github.io`

#### Previewing multiple PRs on GitHub pages

If you've set up to preview the site on your personal GitHub pages, like the above, you can also preview multiple PR branches from your fork under separate paths. For example, for a branch named `my-branch`, would deploy under a subpath of the same name.

From your branch manually build and push.

```shell script
make gh-pages-branch
```

Now you can view your work on `https://githubuserid.github.io/operate-first.github.io/my-branch`

### Manual Site Deployment (Production GitHub Pages)

CI should deploy to GitHub pages automatically, but to manually redeploy

```shell script
make gh-pages
```

### Running on OpenShift

#### Building a containerized image

Customize `.env` file to image and source information as desired. `npm` and the `s2i` command line tool is required. [https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image)

```.env
IMAGE_REPOSITORY=quay.io/my-org/operate-first-app:latest
SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=git@github.com:my-org/operate-first.github.io.git
SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF=my-branch
```

```shell script
make build
```

#### Pushing the container image

Customize `.env` file to image information and container builder.

```.env
CONTAINER_BUILDER=docker
IMAGE_REPOSITORY=quay.io/my-org/odh-dashboard:latest
```

```shell script
make push
```

#### Deploying to OpenShift

Customize `.env` file for deployment information. Required. `oc` command line tool is required.

```.env
OC_URL=https://api.my-host:6443
OC_PROJECT=operate-first
# user and password login
OC_USER=kubeadmin
OC_PASSWORD=my_password
```

or

```.env
OC_URL=https://api.my-host:6443
OC_PROJECT=operate-first
# token login
OC_TOKEN=my_token
```

Run:

```shell script
make deploy
```
