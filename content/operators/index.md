This section contains all information required for operating [Open Data Hub](https://www.opendatahub.io) in a production-grade cloud environment. 

* We maintain an opinionated reference architecture to setup, manage and operate a [continous deployment](/operators/continuous-deployment/) pipeline.
* We also share [SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)](/operators/sre/incident-management/github-receiver-setup.md) principles and guidelines for managing the Operate First services.

Following are some examples of instances where we are deploying and operating ODH:

* [MOC](/operators/moc-cnv-sandbox/docs/about-the-cluster.md)
* [CRC](/continuous-deployment/docs/downstream/crc.md)
* [Quicklab](/continuous-deployment/docs/downstream/quicklab.md)
