title: Operate First for Open Data Hub
description: "Operate First for ODH"
---
 
[Operate First](https://openinfralabs.org/operate-first-manifesto/) is an initiative focused on adding operational intelligence into development of software by operating them in a transparent, open cloud environment.
 
At the Office of the CTO at Red Hat, we can lead the way with [Open Data Hub](https://opendatahub.io/) by opening up our operational knowledge to all open source communities to improve the integration and operability from the source.
 
 
## Getting started
 
Open Data Hub (ODH) is a data and AI platform for the hybrid cloud running on on Red Hat's [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)-based [OpenShiftÂ® Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/) and [Ceph Object Storage](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/storage/ceph).
 
## [Data Science](https://www.operate-first.cloud/data-science/)
 
Get started with tutorials and examples for data science on ODH.
 
## [Users](https://www.operate-first.cloud/users/)
 
Learn how you can engage with ODH and access the deployed components.
 
## [Operators](https://www.operate-first.cloud/operators/)
 
Get started with deploying various components on ODH and find information on operating it.
 
## [Blueprints](https://www.operate-first.cloud/blueprints/)
