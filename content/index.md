title: Operate First for Open Data Hub
description: "Operate First for ODH"
---
 
[Operate First](https://openinfralabs.org/operate-first-manifesto/) is an initiative to operate software in a production-grade environment - bringing users, developers and operators closer together.

The goal is to create an Open Cloud environment, with reproducibility built-in, operated by a Community.

Open means, onboarding and getting involved should mimic the process of an Open Source project, where planning, issue tracking and the code are accessible in a read-only fashion.

Reproducibility caters towards being a blueprint for other setups. If we donâ€™t want each environment to be a snowflake, we should be able to extract best practices that are easy to apply to new environments.
 
At the Office of the CTO at Red Hat, we can lead the way with [Open Data Hub](https://opendatahub.io/) by opening up our operational knowledge to all open source communities to improve the integration and operability from the source.
