In this section you can find documentation pertaining to operations within the Operate First organization. 

## GitOps and Operate First

In Operate First, operations span both cluster operations, as well as operations for managed services. We follow the GitOps operating model for OpenShift cluster and service management. As such we perform all operations for live deployments via GitHub pull-requests. Because of this, practically anyone can submit changes to the state of the cluster. Various applications managed by the Operate First team can also be updated in a similar manner.

## Site Reliability Engineering

The Operate First team's mission is to adapt industry best practices when it comes to SRE in an open and transparent manner. We consume practices as outlined in places like the [Google SRE book][1] and implement them in our operating framework. Here you will find resources and documentation that outline our implementation.
